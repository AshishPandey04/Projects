                                    <li> First rinse 650 grams carrots (8 to 9 medium-sized tender, juicy carrots or 6 to 7 long carrots) a few times in water.Drain the water. Peel the carrots using a vegetable peeler. Set the peeled carrots aside.

                                    </li>
                                    <li>Ensure that the carrots are juicy and tender. You could use any variety of carrots (red or orange), but they should be tender.
                                    </li>
                                    <li> Next, grate the carrots with a box grater or in a food processor. You can measure the grated carrots with a standard measuring cup and you will need about 4 to 4.5 cups of grated carrots.
                                    </li>

                                    <li> Keep stirring this halwa mixture often, scraping the sides of the kadai to remove the evaporated milk solids. Stir the milk solids into the cooking mixture.

                                    <li>Cook the carrot and milk mixture until the liquid is reduced by 75%........</li>

                                    <li>Start by making the samosa dough. To a large bowl, add flour, ajwain, salt and mix well.Add the oil and then start mixing with your fingers.Rub the flour with the oil until the oil is well incorporated in all of the flour. Do this for 3 to 4 minutes, you don‚Äôt want to rush this step.
                                    </li>
                                    <li> Boil potatoes until done.8 to 9 whistles on high heat with natural pressure release if using stove-top pressure cooker or if using Instant Pot, high pressure 12 minutes with natural pressure release on a trivet with 1 cup water in the bottom of the pot.Peel the skin and them mash the potatoes. Set aside.Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a pan on medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add the cumin seeds, fennel seeds and crushed coriander seeds.
                                        
                                        
                                    </li>
                                    <li>D- Add the boiled & mashed potatoes and green peas to the pan.Mix everything together. I use my potato masher to combine the spices and seasonings well with the potatoes and peas. Add the coriander powder, garam masala, amchur, red chili powder and salt. Mix to combine. Once it‚Äôs all well incorporated, remove pan from heat and let the filling cool down a bit.
                                    </li>

                                    <li>Fill the samosa with the potato filling, around 1 to 2 tablespoons. Don‚Äôt overfill the samosa.


                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Now heat oil in a kadai on low heat. To check if oil is ready, drop a small piece of dough into the oil. It should take few seconds to come up to the surface. That means the oil is ready.Drop the shaped samosas into the oil. Fry on low heat. After around 10-12 minutes, the samosa will become firm and light brown in color.........

                                    <li> Rinse 500 grams baby potatoes (20 to 22 nos) well. Remove the mud etc from them by scrubbing or brushing. You can also soak them in some warm water for 15 to 20 minutes and then rinse them.

                                    </li>
                                    <li> Take 3.5 cups water + ¬º tsp salt in a pan.Add the potatoes.
                                    </li>
                                    <li> On a medium to high flame boil the water, so that the potatoes are half cooked. About 9 to 10 minutes. You can even pressure cook the baby potatoes with 3 cups water for 1 whistle.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Peel the potatoes. This task takes a lot of time, so do it while listening to music or watching your favorite tv show. if you want you can keep the peels too.
                                    </li>
                                    <li> With a fork, toothpick or skewer, poke holes in the potatoes all over. This is done so that when cooking on dum, the potatoes absorb the flavors of the masala in which they are getting cooked. Halve them if they are big or you can keep them whole if they are small and then poke them.</li>
                                    <li> Whisk 6 tablespoons fresh full fat curd or yogurt till smooth. Keep aside.
